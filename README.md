## Description
NYC Arrest Data Visualization is a dashboard that helps people to be more informed of the year to date arrest rates in New York City and increases transparency of NYPD actions and arrests. The dashboard displays a maximum of 1000 arrests per screen for the selected arrest type affected in NYC by the NYPD during the current year. The reason why I produced this dashboard is to know if COVID-19 has had any effect on the arrest rate in NYC.
